Data Cleaning and Formatting:
1. 	orders sheet needs populating of the empty customer name, email and country columns. 
	for that we will use the xlookup for each column from relevent sheets.

	the formula: 	=XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode], [search_mode]) 
			customer name -> =XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$B$1:$B$1001,,0) -> here if not found -> blank
			email -> if you use the same method you'll end up with 0 for blanks. instead use this, =IF(XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$C$1:$C$1001,,0)=0,"",XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$C$1:$C$1001,,0))			
			country -> =XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$G$1:$G$1001,,0)

	shortcuts: 	xlookup + tab
			ctrl + shift + pagedown to select the whole column uptil blank cell found (maybe end of the entries)
			F4 for absolute referencing -> value is fixed to what is in cell
			click on the fill handle dot to completly fill the column

	references : 	https://youtu.be/iDg9s7BJ2m4 -> absolute, relative and inter-sheet cell referencing
						
2. 	orders sheet need populating of the empty coffee type, roast type, size, unit price and sales columns.
	for that we will use index-match. this is a dynamic formula.

	the formula: 	=INDEX(array, row_num, [column_num]) 
			=MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type])
			coffee type -> =INDEX(products!$A$1:$G$49,MATCH(orders!$D2,products!$A$1:$A$49,0),MATCH(orders!I$1,products!$A$1:$G$1,0)) -> then drag the fill handle to the rest of the columns (not rows), then double click the fill handle to populate the rows of those columns.
			explaination -> the index takes the table values and specific rows and column. 
					these rows and columns are taken up if the first and second match together returns values.
					the first match checks along the D column ($D_ -> fixed column D and doesn't shift to next column when formula is dragged/copied to other cells) 
					and second match checks along each column for that row 1 (_$1 -> fixed row 1 and doesn't shift to other rows when dragged/copied).		

	shortcuts: 	F4 * 2, F4 * 3 for absolute referencing row, column alone.
			F2 for viewinf fromula and cells referenced.

3. 	sales is populated with =unit price * quantity

4.	add another column coffee type name to fullform the coffee type abbreviations, similarly for roast type

	the formula: 	=IF(I2="Rob","Robusta",IF(I2="Ara","Arabica",IF(I2="Lib","Liberica",IF(I2="Exc","Excelsa",""))))
			=IF(J2="M","Medium",IF(J2="L","Light",IF(J2="D","Dark","")))

5. 	now format the dates into a standard one say day - month name - year, the size column to include 'kg', the unit price and sales columns to have $ sign
	
	the formula: 	select column, go to the format cells panel, select custom and type dd-mmm-yyyy. similarly for size its 0.0 "kg"
			for the unit price and sales columns select those two columns, go to currency drop down in numbers panel and select $

	shortcuts: 	ctrl + 1 to go to format cells panel

6. 	now remove duplicates by selecting whole sheet containing range, go to data tab, data tools panel, remove duplicates.


Create table:
1.	select anywhere, ctrl + T, set table has headers and make sure the range is selected and enter. give table a name in table design, properties panel.
	
	reason as to why we converted the range to a table is so that pivot tables created and get updated much easier.

Pivot table:
1. 	create a pivot table for the orders table
	
	method: go to insert tab -> tables panel -> pivot table -> create on new sheet and enter.
		also enter a name in pivottable analyze tab.
